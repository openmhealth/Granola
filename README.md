# Granola

_*A healthful serializer for your HealthKit data.*_

## Overview

So you want to store your app's [HealthKit](https://developer.apple.com/healthkit/)
data somewhere *outside* of HealthKit, perhaps a remote server for analysis or
backup? Use Granola to serialize your data.

Granola spares you the effort of mapping HealthKit's API to JSON yourself,
and emits JSON that validates against
[schemas developed by Open mHealth](http://www.openmhealth.org/developers/schemas/)
to ensure the data is intuitive and clinically meaningful.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

Granola is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), a dependency manager for Objective-C. If you don't already have CocoaPods installed, you can install it with the following command:
```ruby
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate Granola with your Xcode project, simply add the following line to your `Podfile`:
```ruby
pod 'Granola', :git => 'https://github.com/rkirkendall/Granola.git', :commit => 'fad68fc5b69fbc485727b77687ef21597586fb10'
```

and then run the following command:
```ruby
$ pod install
```

## Usage

### Quick start

First, be sure to study Apple's
[HealthKit Framework Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/HealthKit/Reference/HealthKit_Framework),
which includes code samples illustrating how to ask your app's user for
permission to access their HealthKit data, and how to query that data after
you've gained permission.

Now, let's say you want to see what a "steps" sample data point looks like
serialized to JSON.

```objective-c
// Granola includes OMHSerializer for serializing HealthKit data
#import "OMHSerializer.h"

// (initialize your HKHealthStore instance, request permissions with it)
// ...

// create a query for steps data
HKSampleType *stepsSampleType =
  [HKSampleType quantityTypeForIdentifier:HKQuantityTypeIdentifierStepCount];
HKSampleQuery* query =
  [[HKSampleQuery alloc] initWithSampleType:stepsSampleType
                                  predicate:nil
                                      limit:HKObjectQueryNoLimit
                            sortDescriptors:nil
                             resultsHandler:^(HKSampleQuery *query,
                                              NSArray *results,
                                              NSError *error) {
     if (!results) abort();
     // pick a sample to serialize
     HKQuantitySample *sample = [results first];
     // create and use a serializer instance
     OMHSerializer *serializer = [OMHSerializer new];
     NSString* jsonString = [serializer jsonForSample:sample error:nil];
     NSLog(@"sample json: %@", jsonString);
   }];
// run the query with your authorized HKHealthStore instance
[self.healthStore executeQuery:query];
```

Upon running your code, the console would render the data sample as Open mHealth compliant JSON:

```json
{
  "body" : {
    "step_count" : 45,
    "effective_time_frame" : {
      "time_interval" : {
        "start_date_time" : "2015-05-12T18:58:06.969Z",
        "end_date_time" : "2015-05-12T18:58:32.524Z"
      }
    }
  },
  "header" : {
    "id" : "4A00E553-B01D-4757-ADD0-A4283BABAC6F",
    "creation_date_time" : "2015-05-12T18:58:06.969Z",
    "schema_id" : {
      "namespace" : "omh",
      "name" : "step-count",
      "version" : "1.0"
    }
  }
}
```

### HKObjectType support

The serializer has support for all HealthKit samples (`HKSample`), either through curated Open mHealth schemas or through generic HealthKit schemas. You can take a look at the [mapping table of supported types and their associated schemas](Docs/hkobject_type_coverage.md) to understand how data gets mapped. The `HKObjectType` identifiers are pulled from the
[HealthKit Constant Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/HealthKit/Reference/HealthKit_Constants/#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014710-CH2-DontLinkElementID_3). 

You can retrieve a map (`NSDictionary`) of the supported types in Granola and the class name of the specific serializer they use by calling the static method:
```objective-c 
[OMHHealthKitConstantsMapper allSupportedTypeIdentifiersToClasses]
``` 

You can also retrieve a list of those types, without their associated serializers, using the method:
```objective-c 
[OMHSerializer supportedTypeIdentifiers]
``` 

And retrieve a list of types that serialize with Open mHealth curated schemas (instead of the generic type schemas) by using the method:
```objective-c 
[OMHSerializer supportedTypeIdentifiersWithOMHSchema]
```

Over time, as curated schemas are developed that correspond to the HealthKit data represented by the generic schemas, the generic mappings will be replaced by mappings to the curated schemas.

[contribute](#contributing) support with a pull request.

### Time zones

Granola uses the time zone specified for the `HKMetadataKeyTimeZone` key to serialize timestamps when it is present. If time zone metadata is not provided, Granola uses the default time zone of the application for the UTC offset in timestamps. Although these timestamps are correct, some data, especially older data, that is being serialized may be offset incorrectly if it was originally created by HealthKit in a different time zone than the device is in when Granola serializes it. For example, if a data point was originally created by HealthKit in San Francisco on June 1st, 2015 at 8:00am (-07:00), but then serialized three months later in New York, the timestamp would read 2015-06-01T11:00-04:00. These are technically the same point in time, however they are offset differently.

In a future update, we plan to allow developers to specify the prefered time zone for serializing data points to give them control over how timestamps are serialized.

To setup Granola for development, first pull the code. Then install CocoaPods:
```ruby
$ gem install cocoapods
```

After that, change into the Example directory:
```ruby
$ cd Example

and type:
```ruby
pod install
```

Then open the .xcworkspace file instead of the .xcodeproj file. This will allow you to make changes to the code and run and add tests for any changes you make.
